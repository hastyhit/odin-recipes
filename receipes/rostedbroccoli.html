        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Roasted broccoli is easy to make and so much more flavorsome than boiled. My favorite part is the roasted sliced stem pieces.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>14 ounces broccoli</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Cut broccoli florets from the stalk. Peel the stalk and slice into 1/4-inch slices. Mix florets and stem pieces with olive oil in a bowl and transfer to a baking sheet; season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Roast in the preheated oven until broccoli is tender and lightly browned, about 18 to 20 minutes.</li>
            
        </ol>
